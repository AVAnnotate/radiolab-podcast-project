The hosts also invite on an expert, Josh Greene, who is a neuroscientist from Princeton whose research focuses on the human brain's response to moral quandries. The podcast hosts mention Greene's education and occupation in order to build credibility (ethos), which leads the audience to be more inclined to listen respect his findings on the subject. In addition to Greene's interview, the hosts use audio from various unnamed people who were surveyed as part of Greene's studies on morality. These communicators are presented as representatives of the \"general public,\" and are supposed to be relatable to the podcast's listeners (ethos/pathos)."

Using the famous \"trolley problem\" as an anecdote to better understand how self-driving cars will make decisions about safety, the podcast's overall message is to provoke their listeners to think about the implications of self-driving cars for anyone on the road. They do this by invoking the emotional responses of the unnamed survey participants, who, as a group, represent a \"typical\" moral response to the trolley problem: \"Do you kill one man by pulling a lever or kill five men by doing nothing?\" The survey participants' responses are highly emotional and reactive (for example, \"No! Never!\"), provoking the listener to emotionally respond (pathos) to the dilemma, too."
